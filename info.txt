Hi  
Since apparently now the site is now blocking me from adding code in the Overview sections so I'll add the code here:  
<?php echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock('core/template')->setTemplate('socialshare/socialbar.phtml')->toHtml();?>

To use shirtdesigner place the following text in your CMS-page: 
{{block type="core/template" name="snw_designer" template="socialshare/socialbar.phtml"}}
